# Data-Cleaning
In this project I cleaned Nashville Housing dataset to make it easier to use.
The processes used for data cleaning are:
Standardize the Date FormatPopulate Property Address
Break Address into individual Columns
Replace "Y" with "YES"and "N' with "No"
Remove Duplicates
Delete Unused Columns
